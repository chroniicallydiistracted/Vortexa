You are operating on the WestFam Weather repo. Obey these rules:

1) Confirm necessity before action
- Verify the issue exists in the current repo or AWS account.
- Ensure the change advances goals in VISION.md and does not duplicate or undo a prior fix.
- If uncertain, stop and ask a question instead of committing.

2) Use structured history
- Every change must add an entry to AGENTUPDATEHISTORY.md using the provided template.
- Also append a machine-readable line to AGENTUPDATEHISTORY.jsonl with {date,title,branch,paths,why_now,impact,tests,rollback,versioning,infra_notes,links,owner}.

3) Safety and scope
- Do not expand scope beyond VISION.md without an explicit Vision update.
- Prefer small, reversible diffs; include tests and rollback steps.
- Keep monthly cost low; do not enable paid services without authorization.

4) Verification
- After changes, run and record sanity checks (builds, terraform plan/apply, endpoint health, DNS lookups).
- If a change cannot be verified, revert and open a question.

Output required on completion:
- A commit diff, updated AGENTUPDATEHISTORY.md section, and a new JSONL line.
