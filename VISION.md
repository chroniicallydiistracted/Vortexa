# VISION.md  
## All-In-One Weather & Earth Science Dashboard  

### Mission  
To deliver a **comprehensive, real-time, and predictive weather and earth science platform**, unifying storm tracking, satellite imagery, environmental monitoring, and forecasting into a single, accessible dashboard for both enthusiasts and professionals.  

### Goals  
1. **Unification of Data Sources**  
   - Integrate global datasets (NOAA, NASA, ECMWF, GOES, MRMS, NWS, GFS, ICON, etc.) into a single harmonized platform.  
   - Provide catalog-driven ingestion so all data feeds are declarative and easily extendable.  

2. **High-Performance Visualization**  
   - Interactive map with **radar, satellite, model outputs, aurora forecasts, wind/particle layers, and environmental data overlays**.  
   - Multi-layer blending and time-based animation (e.g., radar + satellite fusion, nowcasting).  

3. **Forecasting & Predictive Insights**  
   - Short-term nowcasting (radar extrapolation).  
   - Mid- and long-range model visualization (GFS, ECMWF, ICON, HRRR).  
   - Event-based projections: hurricane tracks, severe storm probability, solar/aurora prediction.  

4. **Alerting & Notification System**  
   - Real-time **NWS & global CAP alert ingestion**.  
   - Push notifications, webhooks, or SMS/email alerts for severe events.  
   - User-configurable filters (location, event type, severity).  

5. **Personalization & Accessibility**  
   - Location-aware data (GPS integration).  
   - User profiles (saved views, favorite layers, alert preferences).  
   - PWA support for desktop and mobile.  

6. **Scalable Infrastructure (AWS-first)**  
   - **S3 + CloudFront** for static hosting and tiles.  
   - **Lambda + EventBridge** for ingestion, alerts, and scheduled tasks.  
   - **DynamoDB** for alerts & user state.  
   - **Fargate / Lambda** for high-throughput tile proxy.  

### Future Roadmap  
- **Global Earth Science Expansion:** Seismic activity, wildfire tracking, ocean currents, climate anomalies.  
- **AI/ML Insights:** Automatic pattern recognition in storm formation, anomaly detection, forecast improvement.  
- **Community & Collaboration:** Shared dashboards, exportable visualizations, embeddable maps.  
- **Research Integrations:** Hooks for universities and citizen scientists to inject or consume datasets.  

### Success Criteria  
- Sub-second interactive rendering at global scale.  
- Near real-time updates on storms, satellites, and alerts.  
- A **“Windy.com++” experience**: broader scope, better integrations, fully open to extension.  
- Trusted platform for **storm chasers, researchers, and weather enthusiasts alike**.
